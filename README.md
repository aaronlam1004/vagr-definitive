# Vagr (Definitive Version)
## What is Vagr?
It is a pretty badly coded implementation of how the software Vagrant works using **Python**. I made this because my old computer at home ran Vagrant really slowly and it got to the point where it would sometimes freeze my computer. 

NOTE: *The version [here](https://github.com/aaronlam1004/vagr) is an older, worser version.*
## Requirements
- Windows Operating System
- VirtualBox
- Vagr Compatible OVAs
    -  Can create custom based on [the Vagr OVAs guidelines](https://github.com/aaronlam1004/vagr/blob/master/ovas/vagr_ovas_notes.txt)
    -  Can be downloaded from [the Vagr OVAs downloads](https://mega.nz/#F!fslWECaS!ff9DvPb9DRk7nIcA85ZNLQ)
